Adds a disclosure, chosen on a per post/page basis, to a post/page either below the content or above the content.

== Description ==

The Disclosure Picker makes complying with the FTC blogger guidlines about material connections easy.

In plain English, you can pick from a dropdown on each post or page if you need to disclose affiliate links, review copies, etc. There are 5 different "disclosures", which are modified versions of the ones in [Michael Hyatt's post on the subject](http://michaelhyatt.com/five-ways-to-comply-with-the-new-ftc-guidelines-for-bloggers.html "Five Ways to Comply with the New FTC Guidelines for Bloggers"). You can also choose to display the disclosure above or below the content.

The section comes pre-styled with CSS. If your theme uses Twitter's Bootstrap, it uses the `.well-small` class by default. The styling will work with or without Bootstrap.

== Installation ==

1. Download and unzip the file
1. Upload the `/disclosure-picker/` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where exactly does the disclosure go on my pages? =

The disclosure can be placed either just before the main content or just after. You can choose on a per-page basis.

= Can I style the disclosure? =

Yes you can. The `style.css` file in the `disclosure-picker/css/` folder has the default styling. You can override the CSS in your theme's `style.css`.

== Screenshots ==

1. Each post or page can have its own disclosure. Pick from the 5 versions, or choose to have none.
2. The disclosure is placed below the content in it's own styled box.
